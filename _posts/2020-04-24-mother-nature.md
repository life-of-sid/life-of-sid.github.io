***Amidst the collapse of the world during quarantine I sat down and inked down all that I was felt...***

>
My nightmares woke me up and I said enough is enough, <br>
It's the humans who have been treating me so rough. <br>
Untouchable conquerors, they think they are of the Earth, <br> 
Forgetting that it was I who gave them birth. <br>
Raised, nurtured, showed them the ways of Life, <br>
And in return, they stabbed me with a knife. <br>
My wounds have healed but those scars remain, <br>
It's time, they are taught a lesson of pain. <br>
>
>My children, that are the trees, oceans and skies, <br>
You caused them so much harm, tell me why? <br>
You slashed those trees for your own personal greed, <br>
But were unbothered to plant anymore seeds. <br>
In the oceans, I let your boats and ships lay, <br>
Yet you feed my majestic blue child plastic and suffocate it everyday. <br>
Toxic smoke has given my skies blurry eyes, <br>
How selfish of you to be filled with happiness when he cries?<br>
>
>Since the beginning, I've seen you be bold and brave, <br>
But delusional you are, driving yourselves into a destined grave. <br>
For piercing my soul, I need to give you a sign, <br>
A way of showing that it is you who's living on borrowed time.<br>
Untimely chaos, despair and self destruction, you reap what you sow, <br>
All the advanced technology and yet you're at an all time low. <br>
Scrambling your way, looking for help in this war like zone,<br>
I hope you realise that on planet Earth, you're not alone.<br>
>
>You are caged inside and a burden is lifted off of my chest, <br>
My children have got better, less interference has given them rest. <br>
You took my blessings for granted, I had to give you this curse,<br>
For it was needed to bring back some balance in this universe.<br>
In these dark times, you will have to unite and fight,<br>
Walk to the end of the tunnel, you will find a light. <br>
The only way out is to connect with me more as we belong to one another, <br>
I am nature but first, I'll always be a mother.<br>
