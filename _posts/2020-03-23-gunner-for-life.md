Just sharing this wonderful peice I found on my favouriate team: **Arsenal**, it felt extrememly cool. *This was written by **Darryl Ashton** You can actually find it at the link below.*

>We are the mighty Arsenal – <br>
we are a world-class team,<br>
We play our game so<br>
majestically, we really are<br>
supreme.<br>
>
> We play in the English Premier<br>
League – and we fear no<br>
other team,<br>
Not even Manchester United –<br>
do you know what I mean?<br>
>
> Highbury is our home – we<br>
also recruit beginners,<br>
Our famous name is known<br>
to all – we are the world-<br>
class GUNNERS.<br>
>
> We really do have a history –<br>
of famous players in time,<br>
All were simply brilliant –<br>
they really were sublime.<br>
>
> There was goalkeeper, Bob<br>
Wilson – and the manager,<br>
George Graham,<br>
Every match they played –<br>
it was a jam-packed stadium.<br>
>
> The most important game<br>
they played in – was a classic’<br>
FA Cup Final,<br>
When Charlie George let<br>
loose a shot – it really was<br>
unstoppable.<br>
>
> But now they soldier on –<br>
with a super manager,<br>
And they continue to be<br>
a world-class team, Arsenal –<br>
forever.<br>
