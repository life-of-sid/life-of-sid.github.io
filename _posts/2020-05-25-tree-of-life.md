>I'm not the best, I'm full of flaws, 
Why does everything need to be perfect, who makes these laws?
In this unjust cruel world, I have to survive,
Surrounded by all my loved ones, I feel the most alive.
I feel like I am a tree in this dense forest,
I'll explain to you how, listen with interest

>Starting with the roots, they're the best who strongly hold me, 
Its the tightest bond, don't you agree? 
Then comes the trunk which is my heart,
From here on my life takes shape and actually starts.
I form branches and leaves, they're the people in my life,
Friendships, relationships, I'd be a bit alone without them otherwise.
Some people are like branches, they support me and help me grow out,
But when things go rough, they break away and go south.
Some people are like leaves, quite pretty when they form, 
But they wither easily and just go away when there's a storm.
